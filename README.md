# Breast_Cancer_EDA

- In this project, aim was to predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant. I applied basic machine learning concepts (Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest,SVC,KNN) on the Breast Cancer Dataset.

- I first used the NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn libary to perform step wise Exploratory Data Analysis and gained insights regarding the dataset. 
- Next, I split the data into testing and training subsets, and determined an accuracy metric for each model for predicting whether the cancer is benign or malignant.
- Finally, a comparision of all the models was obtained.


#	Model	Score
  | Model | Accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression| 95.91 |
| Random Forest| 95.91 |
| Support Vector Classifiers| 95.91 |
| K - Nearest Neighbors| 94.74 |
| Decision Tree| 92.40 |
